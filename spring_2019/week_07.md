# Week 5
# Last Week's Accomplishments
Helping Coleen rewrite the War/Turn function it was wrong so we worked on it for a little bit
# This Week's Plan  
If the War/Turn function is complete write test cases otherwise work on documentation for test cases and other things in the repo
# Anthing Blocking?
Can't work on the test cases until the function is written/designed not sure what the output is going to be yet
# Notes
