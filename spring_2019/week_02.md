# Week 2
# Last Week's Accomplishments
Made some adjustments to the deal function and the shuffle functions. Trying to get the strucutre right think I'm going to redo the structure
so that they are not in branches but rather in directories.
# This Week's Plan
Going to try and reorganize the steps this week and continue with the current curriclum project.
# Anthing Blocking?
Just need to touch base with the group leader make sure that this change is okay
# Notes
My commits have been coming in as "wallie" on this repository so I'm going to try and switch
it so that it lines up with this user name.
